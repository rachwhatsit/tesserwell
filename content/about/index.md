### Dr. Rachel Wilkerson
#### CEO and Founder

Rachel Wilkerson earned her PhD studying methods to customize causal inference to domain expertise at the University of Warwick. Her work is motivated by a long-held conviction that mathematical models should be attuned to the realities faced by practitioners outside the academy. Previously, she worked at the intersection of public data systems and academic research as a data scientist for Baylor University. A staunch open data advocate, Rachel aims to bridge the gap between data-driven models and complex systems. A West Texas native and Baylor Mathematics alumna, she holds a M.Sc. in Complexity Science from the University of Warwick.
