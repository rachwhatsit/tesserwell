Our software takes a tree structure of a particular case and delivers a set of candidate trees with associated probabilities. This can be used for deliberation and assessing legal risk. 
Our team is currently developing the software to automate this process. We are currently developing a set of case studies to test the software. If you would like to test the software, please let us know.
